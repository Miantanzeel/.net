- Software Framework
	provides frame to work/Basic structure, Provides generic functionality to suppor development ma include libraries, tool sets etc
- FCL(Framework Class Library) or Base Class Library(BCL)
	provides large class library with language interoperability
- CLR(Common Language Runtime)
	an application virtual machine that provides services like security, memory management and exception handling	
* FCL and CLR togather constitute .NET Framework
FCL provides user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms and network communications.

Version History
.NET FRAMEWORKS 1.0,1.1,2.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.6.1,.NET core

.NET language interoperability:
	MSIL(Microsoft intermediate language)
	JIT - Just-In-Time compiler translates MSIL code of an assembly to native code.It is responsible for managing execution
	Assembly - In .net compiled file of language is called assembly 
	Assembly Types:
		1. exe(with main function)
		2. dll(without main function)(reference in exe or dll)
	Assembly contains:
		- Assembly Manifest(Assembly metadata)
		- Type metadata
		- MSIL
		- Set of resources
	CLR - common language runtime
	CLS - common language specification
	CTS - common type system
	BCL - base class library
CTS example System.Int32
	System.Int32 is type/datastructure
